# GSQL-Query-Examples
### *Writing GSQL queries for a publication-centered graph database*

This code walks you through writing search queries for a collection of Covid-19 related articles hosted on a TigerGraph cloud database.

## Motivation
Graph databases are extremely useful for holding large amounts of highly connected data. TigerGraph offers a free platfrom called Cloud where you can spin up your own graph. The Cloud offers a visual search, but this is often inefficient and unrealistic for large amounts of data or for compelx searches. Hence, we need to write search codes in the native language of GSQL.

## Framework
All code written using GSQL on TigerGraph Cloud
